# Cheating Behaviour

A list of behaviours that I consider as cheating and unethical.

I will never personally do these, and I don't like it when others pressure me to do them. However, I won't go out of the way to prevent others from doing them.

## General

- Changing the geolocation to a different country (via VPN, proxy, etc.) to get a cheaper price for a product.
- Using an education email to get a discount on a product, despite already graduated and no longer a student.
